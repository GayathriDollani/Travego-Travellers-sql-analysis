Travego Travellers - SQL Project

Project Overview

The Travego Travellers project is designed to manage records of bus passengers traveling between two cities. It captures journey details such as bus type, distance, and price, along with passenger information including name, gender, and travel cities. The project includes schema creation, table design, data insertion, and SQL queries to retrieve meaningful insights.


Project Structure

1. **Schema Creation**
   A schema named `Travego` is created to organize related tables and data.

2. **Table Creation**

   * **Passenger Table**: Stores passenger name, gender, boarding city, destination city, distance, and bus type.
   * **Price Table**: Stores bus type, distance, and corresponding price for both Sleeper and Sitting buses.

3. **Data Insertion**
   Sample data is added to both tables to simulate real-world travel and fare information.

4. **SQL Queries**
   Includes SQL queries to:

   * Retrieve passenger data based on distance, gender, and bus type.
   * Calculate prices according to travel conditions.
   * Perform basic analytical tasks (e.g., total distance traveled).


Key Features

* **Schema Design**: Logical database structure using relational tables.
* **Data Handling**: Insertions using SQL `INSERT` commands.
* **Query Execution**: Queries written to:
  * Count passengers by gender and distance.
  * Fetch the lowest ticket price per bus type.
  * Display passenger names and travel summaries.
